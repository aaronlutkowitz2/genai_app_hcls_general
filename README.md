General HCLS demo: https://genaihcls-zzsg7awyia-uc.a.run.app/

# Steps to set up 
Go to Terminal on local machine
> cd Documents/ 
> mkdir git_repos

clone repo
> git clone https://github.com/aaronlutkowitz2/genai_app_hcls_general 
> cd genai_app_hcls_general/

first, test app locally
> streamlit run app.py 

build docker image (you need to install docker first)
> docker build . -t genai_hcls 

login to your GCP account to carry code
> gcloud auth application-default login 

build docker container on container registry
> gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/cloudadopt/genai_hcls --timeout=2h 

Go to Cloud Run in your GCP project, create (or update) an app to point to the newest container in Container Registry --> genai_hcls

# Troubleshoot

If there's any auth issues, go to IAM page to add more permissions to the cloud engine service account

If there's an issue with one of the container commands, test that docker code works on docker (locally) 
> docker run -p 8080:8080 --name test_container genai_hcls

Note: you may have to delete test_container first - Then the URL should work with latest code
> docker rm test_container
